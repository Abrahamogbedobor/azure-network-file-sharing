<h1>Network File Permission</h1>
In this tutorial, several perission was granted to users<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Active Directory running in Azure on a Virtual Machine (DC_1)
- A client machine running in Azure on a virtual machine (Client_1) and joined to the domain

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Window Server 2022

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Inspecting DNS A-records on a server (Hostname to IP address mappings)
- Creating new A-records on server (DC_1) and then observe them from the client machine
- Deleting records from server and then inspect/clear client machine DNS cache in order to gain understanding 
- CNAME records (Mapping one hostname to another hostname)
- Root hints

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

In order to inspect A-records on a server, both Client_1 and DC_1 computer were remotely connected into as admin and domain admin respectively. Then Client_1 was used to ping a site called 'MAINFRAME'. The result shows no record was found. Figure1 above was used to illustrate how DNS works, and the preceeding figures were used to further explain DNS in details. From the figures abiove, Client_1 tries to ping a site first, it checks its own 'cache' to see if it could get an IP address for mainframe no result second, it check 'host file' available on all windows computer at c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts also no IP address that matches mainframe hostname. Then lastly, it check its local DNS server DC_1, from the figure above the DNS server cheked and says idk that's when the error message for ping result returns as failed.

This session created A-records on DC_1 server by mapping mainframe to DC_1 IP address. In order to ceate A-records for mainframe hostname, dns was selected from tools tab on DC_1 server management remote desktop. On the far left DC_1 was then expanded (chosen domain name) and 'forward lookup zone' was chosen as shown above (meaning, hostname to ip address). This then brought out the domain name bryanogbe.com, after a click on it, a list of A-records popup. A record simply mean mapping hostname to a physical ip address of the computer hosting the domain. Hence, the figure above shows how mainframe an hostname is been mapped to DC_1 IP address. From figure1, Client_1 is the hostname and it was mapped to 10.0.0.5 also, DC_1 is an hostname and it was mapped to 10.0.0.4.

Furthermore, to manually create A-record for the hostname mainframe and have it added to the list of A-records above, first right clicked on the empty space of the list of A-records then choose host name A. The popup box that comes up was then filled with the hostname to be mapped as well as chosen ip address of the domain (10.0.0.4). After successfully mapping, an attempt was then made to re-ping mainframe and the result was documented as shown above.

The above figure shows the command used in checking Client_1 local cache with the aim of retrieving the ip address of an hostname. Previously, this lab have illustrated how DNS works when user typed in a hostname on a search engine. First, the system check its own local cache for the IP address of the hostname, then it check host file and finally a check on local DNS server before displaying results. To check a system cache for ip address, ipconfig \displaydns waas used. From the above result, Client_1 were able to find the IP address of mainframe from its cache instead of going through DNS server or host file. Note, if mainframe ip address is change to let;s say 7.7.7.7 Client-1 will still be able to ping and get a rsult. However, that result would be from its old ip address. To rsolved the issue of old ip addrss still appearing on system local dns local cache, we used ipconfig /flushdns to clean-up compiuter cache.

CNAME stands for Canonical-Name, and it is used in mapping sub-domain to a root domain. For example, google.com (sub-domain) www.google.com (root domain). In a nutshell CNAME enable us to map a name to another name. When the mapping is done, one could search for search.google.com and same expected result for www.google.com will be derived. The above figure shows how CNAME is added to DC-1 for mapping. From figure2, ping command was carried oiut on search as shown the result came for www.google.com this is because search is mapped to it. It is very important to always flushdns when using A-records and CNAME records.

Root hint helps to resolved queries such as sites that are not currently on DNS server for instance bbc.co.iuk, espn.com and many other sites. The above figure further explains how root hint is being used and what location on DC-1 server management it's located.
